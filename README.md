# Surfalot CMS for osCommerce 2.3.4 Community Edition EDGE

Surfalot CMS is an osCommerce App designed to help the developer and shop
owner alike build, maintain, and organize content easily in one place.
TinyMCE is integrated to provide WYSIWYG content editing.

Create new content and insert it into your navigation quickly and easily
directly in the admin. Edit content on existing pages by placing a small
template code snippet on your target page. The responsive features of
